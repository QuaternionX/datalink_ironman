Document the Ironman protocol
add options in the datafile parser to
	-set the watch model
	-set the order of phone entries
	-set the spacing of the lines
	-set all other options that can be specified on the commandline
being able to abort a transfer while the screen is flashing would be nice

figure out why just sending alarms will corrupt the phone entries
(later entries like 17 or so)

question from a user,
I can't seem to move fast enough for me to put my watch in front of the
screen before your program starts sending data to the watch...

How about showing the initializing sequence (the many bars on the screen
that makes DataLink go beeping while in COMM mode), then wait for a key
to be pressed before actually sending the data?

probably not a bad idea to show the sync signal until the user initiates
the data mode, also possibly have an option for the time to wait while
displaying the sync signal
