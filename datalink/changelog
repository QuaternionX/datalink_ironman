	:
	-serblink.c 
	along with another wiring diagram, the serlbink program
TODO: What all has chnaged?
	 
	modified as well as another wiring diagram.
	-Timer seconds is now initalized to zero for each timer
	 instead of being set to the last value given.  Other
	 variables are linewise initalized to zero.
	-Dependences are remade if the make file is newer than the
	 depend file.
07-21-2002:
	-Fixed the setwatch options of -app and +app to say appointments
	 instead of wristapp.
	-setwatch was trying to run svgablink with -150S instead of -150s
	-The -file (for creating a DEBUGOUTPUT) was broken, fixed.
07-17-2002: aka 1.0.0
	-Added header files for libc functions we are already using,
	 but weren't including the proper header files.
	-Switched to using tmpfile instead of tmpnam for the temporary
	 file, this will fix the compiler warnings.
	-The newer bison required a semicolon and would not compile
	 until it was added.
	-Replaced tmpnam() with mkstemp() because the compiler gave
	 warnings about tmpnam being a possible security hole.
	-Dependency information now goes in the file depend and will be
	 calculated if the file doesn't exist.

12-16-2001:
	-Changed license to GPL (with permission from all 4 authors).
	-Added info to readme about GPL and about lack of support from Timex.
	-Created manpages for svgablink, serblink, setwatch, and settime
	 They still need work - I'll get to it when I can.
	-Changed settime default to ironman for consistency w/ setwatch.
	-Fixed apparent missing semicolon in dataread.y.
	-Added DESTDIR to Makefile to be more friendly with Debian packaging.
	-Split Makefile "install" rule into "install" (for basic datalink
	 user requirements) and "install-devel" for items needed only for
	 development.
	-Added Makefile "uninstall" rule.

02-14-2001:
The changes listed below from Frank Denis were incorporated with exception
of the time of the week information, I'll have to look into that later.
More important user visible changes are as follows,
	It will now only search in the users path for serblink and svgablink
		not any hard-coded paths.  Previous behavior was to try
		the user path and if it wasn't found, try executing
		the program in the current working directory.
	settime is now installed by default and will accept a command line for
		the different types of watches
	For me, svgablink no longer hangs on exit

02-04-2001:
I don't see the problem with the day of week.  I'm reverting back to
the previous code.  Will have to investigate sometime.  On my watch
the code is correct as it used to be (and is now again).
-- David Fries

04-22-2000:
Fixed a bug with the day of the week that was shifted by one. Please report
if it broke something.
-- Frank Denis

04-20-2000:
Fixed the path to svgablink.
The datalink 150 S protocol was implemented but the "-150s" option was
rejected in setwatch. Fixed.
-- Frank Denis

04-17-2000:
Add support for Datalink 150 S watches
-- Frank Denis


04-14-2000:
Lots, lots, lots of cleanups to the source code in order to make it compile
on modern compilers.
-- Frank Denis


01-05-2000:
Added a patch from Scottie Shore <sshore@escape.ca> for a Y2K problem.
As localtime(3) reads,
       tm_year
              The number of years since 1900.
The watch is expecting the last two digits and displays A0 for the year instead of 00.  Fix is to take the year % 100.
-- David Fries


12-11-1999:
Added a patch from Danilo Fiorenzano <danilo@telusplanet.net> to
Added new function "maxPriority()" to switch to SCHED_RR kernel scheduling
policy at maximum priority and lock all pages into real memory, in order
to improve timing accuracy.
-- David Fries
