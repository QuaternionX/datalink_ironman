02-14-2001:
The changes listed below from Frank Denis were incorporated with exception
of the time of the week information, I'll have to look into that later.
More important user visible changes are as follows,
	It will now only search in the users path for serblink and svgablink
		not any hard-coded paths.  Previous behavior was to try
		the user path and if it wasn't found, try executing
		the program in the current working directory.
	settime is now installed by default and will accept a command line for
		the different types of watches
	For me, svgablink no longer hangs on exit

I don't see the problem with the day of week.  I'm reverting back to
the previous code.  Will have to investigate sometime.  On my watch
the code is correct as it used to be (and is now again).

if it broke something.
-- Frank Denis

04-20-2000:
Fixed the path to svgablink.
The datalink 150 S protocol was implemented but the "-150s" option was
rejected in setwatch. Fixed.

Lots, lots, lots of cleanups to the source code in order to make it compile
on modern compilers.

01-05-2000:
Added a patch from Scottie Shore <sshore@escape.ca> for a Y2K problem.
As localtime(3) reads,
       tm_year
              The number of years since 1900.
The watch is expecting the last two digits and displays A0 for the year instead of 00.  Fix is to take the year % 100.

Added a patch from Danilo Fiorenzano <danilo@telusplanet.net> to

to improve timing accuracy.
